# REAL MADRID LANDING PAGE

Real Madrid is the football team I've always supported. Football as a whole, and Real specifically are areas I'm very passionate about. As this site is the first site I've built, I chose Real Madrid as my inspiration because I believe that building anything around a subject you have a strong passion and affinity for, makes the ability to convey these feelings across a lot easier.

Another reason for choosing this subject specifically, was that when I visited Real Madrid's official site I didn't feel that the most recent and impressive accolades the club has achieved over their recent history were shown on their main page. As the Club is a huge entity there is more focus on recent news, and the site is split into the men's first team, the youth teams, the women's first team and the basketball team. As such and because my passion is football I chose to focus solely on the men's first team, their past legends and achievements and current squad. 

My hope is that the user finds this site a useful page with information highlighting the football side, as well as the top achievments in recent history of Real Madrid. The User should be able to navigate the site easily, and should they wish to visit the official site there are links provided which also allows them to do this. Social media links are also on the footer of all the pages on the site which link to the same sites as the official website does.

I hope you find your experience on the site reflects the passion and feelings that Madridistas feel when supporting our team.

## FEATURES

By constantly putting the user's experience at the forefront of the design, the site ensures that they have access to all three main pages of the site at all times. This was achieved by adding a flexible menu in the header which displays as a dropdown on mobile and smaller devices, and as direct links on bigger screen sizes. On bigger screens the design also makes the page the user is currently on underlined in the top bar so that they know exactly what section they are on, and don't feel lost or confused. By doing this the intention is that the user feels confident moving around the site, knows what section they are in at all times, and feels happy to explore the site fully, knowing they are able to return to where they were last with ease. 

### Main Features

This Real Madrid landing/tribute page was designed to reflect the spirit of the club as much as possible. The colour combinations used in the design were inspired by the clubs colours and also those of some of our kits.

Even though the Club's main colour is white, I decided to go with a darker theme as I believe people tend to find this more appealing. I also believed it would work as a nice contrast to the Official Real Madrid page which has a light theme with navy highlighted elements. The colour scheme I went for in the end prioritises navy, black and gold as a result.

Any external links have been designed to open in a new tab so that the user always has access to the landing page should they wish to return.
