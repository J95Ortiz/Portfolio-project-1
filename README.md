# REAL MADRID LANDING PAGE

Real Madrid is the football team I've always supported. Football as a whole, and Real specifically are areas I'm very passionate about. As this site is the first site I've built, I chose Real Madrid as my inspiration because I believe that building anything around a subject you have a strong passion and affinity for, makes the ability to convey these feelings across a lot easier.

Another reason for choosing this subject specifically, was that when I visited Real Madrid's official site I didn't feel that the most recent and impressive accolades the club has achieved over their recent history were shown on their main page. As the Club is a huge entity, there's more focus on recent news, and the site is split into the men's first team, the youth teams, the woman's first team and the basketball team. As such and because my passion is football, I chose to focus solely on the men's first team, their past legends and achievements and current squad. 

My hope is that the user finds this site a useful page which highlights the football side, as well as the top achievments in recent history of Real Madrid. The User should be able to navigate the site easily, and should they wish to visit the official site there are links provided which would allow them to do this.

I hope you find your experience on the site reflects the passion and feelings that Madridistas feel when supporting our team.
