# REAL MADRID LANDING PAGE

## INTRODUCTION

Real Madrid F.C. are one of the most successful clubs in football history. This site was created for anyone wanting to know more about the club's recent history, and was designed with the aim that a user feels like they are accessing a fan club extension of the official website.

The reason for choosing to build a site around such a big entity as Real Madrid was that when I visited their site, the main focus is on the latest news, results and upcoming fixtures. The club also have a Women's Team, at least two professional youth squads and a basketball team. Because of this diversity I didn't feel that the current mens first team squad and their most recent accolades were easily accessible on the official site. 

I hope you enjoy your experience on the site and find it reflects the passion and feelings that Madridistas feel when supporting our team.

## USER EXPERIENCE

### Overview

The user's experience and feel was the priority of the design, with the main aim being that they are able to identify exactly what the site was about when they visit as well as feeling confident navigating around the full site.

### Wireframes Created

The wireframes created to represent what the initial structure and layout for the site were created on Balsmiq. Although the layout of the final site does vary slightly from the initial wireframes these can be seen below:

*** BALSAMIQ SCREENSHOTS ***

### Site Structure

*** LAY OUT THE 4 PAGES WITH SCREENSHOTS AND LAYOUT ***

This Real Madrid site is split into 3 main pages:

1. The Main Landing page
2. The Squad page
3. The Lotto page

All of these are accessible for the user regardless on what page of the site they're on via the navigation menu at the top of their screen. 

There is also a 4th page which will only be visible to the user once they complete and submit the form in the Lotto page. Following comments from a user, links were added to this page so they can return to any of the main pages directly from the menu rather than have to go back.

### Design Choices

This Real Madrid landing/tribute page was designed to reflect the spirit of the club as much as possible. The colour combinations used in the design were inspired by the club colours and also those of some of their kits.

Even though the Club's main colour is white, the site was designed with a darker theme in mind as people tend to find this more appealing. This alternatice colour scheme should work as a nice contrast to the Official Real Madrid page which has a light theme with navy highlighted elements. The final colour scheme for the site prioritises navy, black and gold.

## FEATURES

By constantly putting the user's experience at the forefront of the design, the site ensures that they have access to all three main pages of the site at all times. This was achieved by adding a flexible menu in the header which displays as a dropdown on mobile and smaller devices, and as direct links on bigger screen sizes. On bigger screens the design also makes the page the user is currently on underlined in the top bar so that they know exactly what section they are on, and don't feel lost or confused. By doing this the intention is that the user feels confident moving around the site, knows what section they are in at all times, and feels happy to explore the site fully, knowing they are able to return to where they were last with ease. 

My hope is that the user finds this site a useful page with information highlighting the football side, as well as the top achievments in recent history of Real Madrid. The User should be able to navigate the site easily, and should they wish to visit the official site there are links provided which also allows them to do this. Social media links are also on the footer of all the pages on the site which link to the same sites as the official website does.

### Main Features

The Site is split into three main sections, with a landing page appearing when the user submits the form.

Any external links have been designed to open in a new tab so that the user always has access to the landing page should they wish to return.

The Club's crest was used as a background across all pages so as to ensure the user feels the content across all pages on the site are related.

#### Navigation bar and Dropdown Menu

The navigation bar was designed to be flexible and appears differently across different devices depending on the screen size of the display.

On mobile screens (unless landscape), the menu will appear as a dropdown where the user can then select which page they want to visit. 

On larger screens and landscape phone the bar will appear as a menu instead with links to all the pages on display and easily accessible.

## ADDITIONAL INFO

Real Madrid is the football team I've always supported. Football as a whole, and Real specifically are areas I'm very passionate about. As this site is the first site I've built, I chose Real Madrid as my inspiration because I believe that building anything around a subject you have a strong passion and affinity for, makes the ability to convey these feelings across a lot easier.

### Learning Outcomes

Better nunderstanding around flexbox, CSS & Positioning.

Learned how to link different pages together & proved to myself I have the initiative to look for solutions online when I get stuck.

It's a great learning processand helped me become better at planning and gave me exposure to various technologies and platforms which I'll be using in my future Web Development Career such as wireframes, repositories, favicons etc.
